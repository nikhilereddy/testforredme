## ‚ú® 1. Introduction

The **FitNexx Android Application** is an innovative mobile application built using Kotlin and Android Studio. It is designed to empower users to achieve their fitness goals by providing personalized workout plans, real-time tracking, and innovative features in a seamless, user-friendly interface.

This application centers around core principles of fitness management ‚Äî tracking daily activity, customizing routines, analyzing progress, and fostering consistent habits. In its current prototype, the app stores data locally using RoomDB, enabling core functionality like step counting and basic analytics without requiring constant internet access.

Integration with a custom REST API hosted on MongoDB for data persistence, along with Firebase for authentication, is implemented for secure user management. Future updates will introduce advanced features such as biometric authentication, offline synchronization with cloud sync, real-time push notifications, and multi-language support to enhance accessibility and user engagement.

---

## üéØ 2. Purpose

The purpose of the FitNexx Fitness App is to develop a comprehensive, engaging mobile platform that assists users in managing their fitness journeys effectively. The app aims to simplify the often overwhelming process of fitness tracking by enabling users to create custom workouts, monitor health metrics like steps and hydration, visualize progress through interactive charts, and receive motivational rewards. A key emphasis is on incorporating gamification and adaptive analytics to make fitness fun and sustainable, encouraging long-term adherence to healthy habits. The app is tailored to support users from beginners to advanced enthusiasts, with features like live movement tracking, context-based alerts, and exportable reports. By leveraging local storage for offline use and integrating with online databases for seamless data access, FitNexx promotes inclusivity, especially for users in regions with variable internet connectivity, such as South Africa. Ultimately, it empowers individuals to take control of their physical well-being through intelligent recommendations, progress insights, and a supportive ecosystem that adapts to their needs.

## üé® 3. Design Decisions

The design decisions for the app are informed by the research, planning, and implementation requirements. These decisions aim to ensure functionality, usability, and engagement while adhering to the technical and academic requirements.

### Key design decisions:

- **Intuitive and Engaging Layout**: The UI is crafted to be visually appealing and straightforward to navigate, drawing users in with a modern aesthetic that motivates regular use for workouts and tracking. Consistent layouts, such as bottom navigation bars, paired with clean DejaVu Sans fonts and a blue, white, and black cohesive color scheme, create a professional and unified experience. Adequate spacing between elements, like buttons and progress indicators, reduces clutter and enhances usability, making it easy for users to interact without frustration. The predominant use of blue tones evokes energy, trust, and calmness‚Äîideal for a fitness app‚Äîas it symbolizes movement and progress, aligning with the app's theme of "Step Into The Next You" and encouraging a positive mindset during exercise sessions.
- **Error Handling**: The app is engineered for robustness, gracefully managing invalid inputs like incorrect login credentials or incomplete workout forms without crashing. Input validation is integrated throughout, such as checking for required fields in user registration or ensuring numerical entries for reps and steps are positive integers, with user-friendly error messages displayed via toasts or dialogs to guide corrections and maintain a smooth experience.
- **Gamification Elements**: Features like earning points and building streaks for consistent water intake or goal completion are designed to leverage psychological principles of reward and habit formation. This makes the app more interactive and addictive in a positive way, transforming routine tracking into an engaging game that motivates users to stay committed to their fitness routines over time.
- **Visual Feedback (Adaptive Analytics and Interactive Fitness Visuals)**: Analytics are presented through interactive bar graphs and charts that track metrics like steps, water intake, and calories burned. Users can filter by date range for detailed insights, simplifying complex data into actionable visuals. This design ensures quick comprehension of health status, helping users spot improvements or gaps without manual analysis.
- **Online Database**: User data is persisted in MongoDB for flexible storage of workouts, logs, and metrics, while Firebase handles authentication and authorization for secure SSO logins. This hybrid approach allows seamless access across devices, automatic backups, and scalability for future growth. Advantages include enhanced data security through encryption, real-time synchronization when online, and reliability in preventing data loss, providing a consistent experience whether users switch phones or recover accounts.
- **Smart Notifications and Context-Based Alerts**: Notifications are intelligent and personalized, factoring in user activity, and performance data. For instance, alerts might notify users of remaining calories to burn, suggest hydration, or remind them of steps needed to hit daily goals. This design avoids generic spam, delivering timely, relevant prompts that feel supportive rather than intrusive.

## üíª 5. Setting Up the Project Locally & Usage

### Prerequisites:

- Android Studio IDE
- JDK 17+
- Kotlin 1.8+
- Gradle 8.0+
- Android device or emulator with Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher
- Internet connection (only required for future Firebase functionality)

### Installation Steps:

#### Method 1: Downloading the ZIP File from GitHub

1. **Download the ZIP**: Click the green "Code" button near the top-right of the page. In the dropdown menu, select "Download ZIP". This will download a compressed file (e.g., repo-name-main.zip) to your computer's Downloads folder. The file size depends on the repo but is usually quick to download.
2. **Extract the ZIP File**: Locate the downloaded ZIP file in your file explorer (e.g., File Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS). Right-click the file and choose "Extract All" (Windows) or double-click to unzip (macOS). Extract it to a convenient location, such as your Documents or Desktop folder. This creates a new folder with the repo's contents (e.g., repo-name-main). Avoid extracting to a path with spaces or special characters, as this can cause build issues.
3. **Open the Project in Android Studio**: Launch Android Studio. If it's your first time or no project is open, you'll see the Welcome screen. Click "Open" (or "Open an existing project" in older versions). Navigate to the extracted folder and select it (make sure you select the root folder containing files like build.gradle and settings.gradle). Click "OK" to import the project. Android Studio will load the project structure in the Project view (usually on the left sidebar).
4. **Wait for Gradle Sync**: Once the project opens, Android Studio will automatically start syncing with Gradle files. This process downloads dependencies (like libraries specified in build.gradle) and configures the build environment. You'll see a progress bar at the bottom of the window saying "Gradle sync in progress" or similar. This can take 1-10 minutes depending on your internet speed and the project's complexity‚Äîbe patient and don't close Android Studio. If it fails (e.g., due to network issues), click the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" icon (elephant symbol) in the toolbar to retry. Check the "Event Log" or "Build" tab at the bottom for error details, and resolve any issues like updating the Gradle version if prompted.
5. **Resolve Any Initial Issues**: After sync completes successfully (you'll see "Gradle sync finished" in the status bar), review the project. If there are errors (red underlines in code), fix them by following prompts, such as accepting SDK license agreements (via Tools > SDK Manager) or updating outdated dependencies in build.gradle files.

#### Method 2: Using GitHub Desktop for Cloning

1. **Clone the Repository**: In your browser, go to the GitHub repo page and click the green "Code" button. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo-name.git). Open GitHub Desktop, click "File" > "Clone repository" (or the "+" button in the top-left). In the dialog, paste the URL into the "URL" tab, choose a local path to save it (e.g., Documents/GitHub/repo-name), and click "Clone". This downloads the entire repo to your computer, including version history. The process might take a few minutes.
2. **Open the Cloned Project in Android Studio**: Once cloned, note the local folder path in GitHub Desktop (visible in the repository list). Launch Android Studio, click "Open" from the Welcome screen, and navigate to the cloned folder (select the root with build.gradle). Proceed as in Step 4 of Method 1.
3. **Wait for Gradle Sync**: Follow the same Gradle sync process as in Method 1, Step 5. If you make changes later, you can use GitHub Desktop to commit and push them.

#### Building and Running the App on Your Phone

After opening the project via either method and successful Gradle sync, you can build and install the app on a physical Android phone. This requires a USB cable and enabling developer options on your phone. (Alternatively, you could use an emulator via AVD Manager in Android Studio, but we'll focus on a physical device as requested.)

Also, enable "Install via USB" if available (for some devices). Set "Default USB configuration" to "File Transfer" or "MTP" for better connectivity.
3. **Connect Your Phone to the Computer**: Use a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer. On your phone, allow USB debugging when prompted (check "Always allow from this computer" for future ease). Your computer might install drivers automatically; if not, download them from your phone manufacturer's site (e.g., Samsung or Google).
4. **Configure and Run the App in Android Studio**: In Android Studio, click the green "Run" button (play icon) in the toolbar, or go to Run > Run 'app'. In the "Select Deployment Target" dialog, your connected phone should appear (e.g., "Pixel 6 [serial number]"). Select it and click "OK". Android Studio will build the APK (this might take 1-5 minutes the first time, showing "Building" in the status bar), install it on your phone, and launch the app automatically.
5. **Handle Installation Prompts**: On your phone, you may see a prompt to install the app‚Äîtap "Install". If it warns about unknown sources, go to Settings > Apps > Special app access > Install unknown apps, and allow Android Studio or Chrome. After installation, the app should open. If it crashes, check the "Run" tab in Android Studio for logcat errors and debug accordingly.
6. **Test and Uninstall if Needed**: Use the app on your phone. To stop debugging, click the red "Stop" button in Android Studio. To uninstall, go to your phone's Settings > Apps, find the app, and tap "Uninstall".

(Optional) Place `google-services.json` in the app folder for future Firebase setup

### Usage
